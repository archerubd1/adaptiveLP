Perfect. Let’s now define exactly how to launch and execute the Adaptive Learning Journey Engine (ALJE) — the first system we built (not PCSE).

This aligns with your adaptiveLP.docx orchestration design

✅ TL;DR — How to Launch the Adaptive Learning Path Engine

You execute it in 4 clear stages:

Setup database

Train ML model (once)

Trigger Python engine (manual / PHP / cron)

View dashboard

That’s it.

Below is the full production execution flow.

🧱 STEP 1 — Setup Database

Import:

/database/schema.sql


Using:

phpMyAdmin (UWAMP)

GoDaddy cPanel → Import

Then verify tables:

learners
learning_events
learner_journey_state
adaptive_recommendations
faculty_overrides

🐍 STEP 2 — Train ML Model (ONE TIME)

Go inside:

/python/


Install:

pip install mysql-connector-python pandas scikit-learn


Train model:

python train_model.py


This generates:

model.pkl


You only retrain when updating model logic.

▶ STEP 3 — Execute Adaptive Engine

You have 3 ways to run it.

OPTION A — Manual CLI (Testing Mode)

From /python/:

python run_engine.py 1


Where:

1 = learner_id


After execution, check DB:

SELECT * FROM adaptive_recommendations;


You should see ranked journey actions.

OPTION B — Via PHP (Production Mode)

Open browser:

http://localhost/astraal-adaptive-engine/public_html/api/trigger_engine.php


OR on GoDaddy:

https://yourdomain.com/api/trigger_engine.php


That PHP file runs:

exec("python3 /home/username/python/run_engine.py $learner_id");


Then redirects to dashboard.

OPTION C — Nightly Cron (Recommended)

GoDaddy → cPanel → Cron Jobs

Add:

php /home/username/public_html/cron/nightly_engine.php


Schedule:

Every night at 2 AM

Or every 6 hours

This recalculates all learners.

🖥 STEP 4 — View Dashboard

Open:

/public_html/dashboard.php


You will see:

Journey state

🧪 QUICK TEST DATA (Minimal Demo Setup)

Insert learner:

INSERT INTO learners (name,email)
VALUES ('Test Learner','test@example.com');


Insert test events:

INSERT INTO learning_events
(learner_id,event_type,event_value,source)
VALUES
(1,'learning_intent',1,'UI'),
(1,'milestone_completed',1,'UI');


Then run:

python run_engine.py 1


Now check:

SELECT * FROM adaptive_recommendations;

⚠ COMMON ISSUES
1️⃣ "python3 not found"

On GoDaddy use full path:

exec("/usr/local/bin/python3 /home/username/python/run_engine.py 1");

2️⃣ No recommendations generated

Check:

model.pkl exists

DB credentials correct

learning_events not empty

3️⃣ learner_journey_state not updating

Currently engine only writes recommendations.

If you want full state recalculation — we can extend run_engine.py to update:

learner_journey_state
